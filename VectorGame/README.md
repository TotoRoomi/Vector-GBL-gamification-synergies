# VECTOR GAME
This is part of Toto Roomi and Harald Olins Bachelor thesis on gamification and it's synergies. What combinations of game mechanics drive the motivation of students and in what way? 

In this project we assess the feasibility of implementing synergies of gamifications. 

The game is about simple Vector addition. You learn how to do these things visually.
